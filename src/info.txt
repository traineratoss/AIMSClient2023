Bearer tokens are a general class of token that grants access to the party in possession of the token. Access tokens, ID tokens, and self-signed JWTs are all bearer tokens.

Using bearer tokens for authentication relies on the security provided by an encrypted protocol, such as HTTPS; if a bearer token is intercepted, it can be used by a bad actor to gain access.
